# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to uncover and identify trends. Understanding these trends will affect future business decisions and production scheduling.

## Analysis and Challenges
We have found that theaters are quite successful.

-There were 525 successful theater Kickstarters in the US on record.
-While there are only a total of 604 Kickstarter campaigns for plays in Great Britain, the "theater" category is the most successful.

In fact, we have found that plays (subcategory of theaters) was by far the most successful sub-category.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
We have found that the month that launched the most successful Kickstarter campaigns was May.

-January, June, July and October all had roughly the same number of failed campaigns launched.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
We have found that successful plays deemed successful to have a goal of $20,000 or less.

-The standard deviations are all roughly twice the IQR in each distribution, except in the failed Kickstarters, where the standard deviation is closer to three times the IQR. Knowing this allows us to see that there were some failed Kickstarters with very high goals.
-There were some outlier instances of plays with high goals of more than $40,000 that still succeeded. However, the data shows us that this is not a statistically commonly occuring incidence.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
