# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to uncover and identify trends. Understanding these trends will affect future business decisions and production scheduling.

## Analysis and Challenges

We have found that theaters are quite successful.

In fact, we have found that plays (subcategory of theaters) was by far the most successful sub-category.

- There were 525 successful theater Kickstarters in the US on record.
- While there are only a total of 604 Kickstarter campaigns for plays in Great Britain, the "theater" category is the most successful.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
We have found that the month that launched the most successful Theater Kickstarter campaigns was May.

- January, June, July and October all had roughly the same number of failed campaigns launched.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
We have found that successful plays deemed successful to have a goal of $20,000 or less.

- The standard deviations are all roughly twice the IQR in each distribution, except in the failed Kickstarters, where the standard deviation is closer to three times the IQR. Knowing this allows us to see that there were some failed Kickstarters with very high goals.
- There were some outlier instances of plays with high goals of more than $40,000 that still succeeded. However, the data shows us that this is not a statistically commonly occuring incidence.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The main challenge in this analysis was determining outliers and separating them from the rest of the data to avoid skewing of results.

## Results

- Theater productions, namely plays, have the highest success rate across kickstarters.
- Our data on Outcomes based on Launch Date shows us that theater kickstarters tend to consistently carry through to completion without cancellation.
- Furthermore, it shows us that the month of May is when the most successful theater kickstarters launch. 
- Based on the data on Outcomes based on Goals, we can conclude that a realistic goal of $20,000 or less will yield the highest chance of success for Theater kickstarters.

NOTE: The focus of the analysis stayed primarily on theater and play kickstarters and does not include in-depth views of other Categories or Subcategories. Additional category analyses such as descriptive statistics and outcome trend lines may be added for a more robust comparison. 

The dataset also originates from a single database of kickstarters and isn't an all-inclusive global table. The database appears to not have been updated in a number of years and an updated analysis may be needed for futher decision making.
